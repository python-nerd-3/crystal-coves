    <h1>Known Bugs</h1>
    <h2>The game is very glitchy on mobile.</h2>
    <p>Known symptoms: Weird spacing of sidebar (primarily Safari), offcentered tapping, no saving and more (cant rember)</p>
    <p>This is because Safari hates developers just like the rest of Apple</p>
    <h2>The page crashes often</h2>
    <p>This is caused by the fact I suck at optimizing.</p>
    <h2>I get immediately redirected to a rickroll when I open the page</h2>
    <p>Either your save file got corrupted (sad) or you tried to edit it (deserved).</p>
    <h2>My ores have been reverted</h2>
    <p>If you have another tab open with the up-to-date ores you can go there and press save.</p>
    <p>Else, there is no way to recover the data. To avoid this, do not have multiple tabs of Crystal Coves open</p>
    <h2>The ore counter is not working on one of my ores</h2>
    <p>That means you have over 100000 of that ore. There is no way to fix this other than getting a life.</p>
    <h2>The website doesn't update</h2>
    <p>This is caused by your browser caching the website for no reason. For a permanent fix, Inspect Element -> Network -> check Disable Cache on the main page.</p>
