    "stone": "It's just stone. What did you expect? Just a solid hunk of rock, nothing special. (Designed by Samuel Green)",
    "voidElement": "Wat",
    "copper": "A useful but common ore found all over the mine. Please don't ignore it, minerals have feelings too. (Designed by Samuel Green)",
    "coal": "Dead dino. The question is, what killed the dinos? Was it caused by global warming from the burning of fossil fuels? (Designed by Samuel Green)",
    "quartz": "Quartz is a common yet useful mineral often found in tech. It has just a few variants like citrine, amethyst, tiger's eye, agate, smoky quartz, rose quartz, aventurine, jasper, onyx, blue quartz, ametrine, quartz, prasiolite, rutilated quartz, clear quartz, mtorolite, chalcedony, carnelian, milky quartz, onyx, jasper, carnelian, chrysoprase, heliotrope.

    "iron": "Iron was often considered to be uncommon, until people got common sense. Then they lost it again. The cycle of life. (Designed by Samuel Green)",

    "tungsten": "This Ore Cured My Morality: All the people here who bought this wireless tungsten Ore to admire its surreal heft have precisely the wrong mindset. I, in my exalted wisdom and unbridled ambition, bought this Ore to become fully accustomed to the intensity of its density, to make its weight bearable and in fact normal to me, so that all the world around me may fade into a fluffy arena of gravitational inconsequence. And it has worked, to profound success. I have carried the tungsten with me, have grown attached to the downward pull of its small form, its desire to be one with the floor. This force has become so normal to me that lifting any other object now feels like lifting cotton candy, or a fluffy pillow. Big burly manly men who pump iron now seem to me as little children who raise mere aluminum.",
    "amethyst": "Shiny crystal. OoooOoOOoOoOoOooOoOoOOoO",
    "basalt": "Basalt has been found containing rare ores inside of it, but many of these rare ores have been found before basalt started appearing independently. I'm confused. (Idea by Samuel Green)",

    "relic": "This bronze relic is from 2,500 years ago during a time of prosperity. Don't ask why it's fully in tact, we don't know why it is either.",
    "emerald": "Emeralds were once considered one of the rarest ores in the mine, until people gained the courage to dig deeper. Many rarer ores were found including the writings of the myths of the Unseens. The descriptions should be silly why did I add lore ihuvbfiuhdf (disignd by ges who)",
    "diamond": "Muijnecraft????? (Designed by Samuel Green)",
    "fossil": "Remember when we said coal was dead dino? This must be a dino put in an eternal fate of suffering. Wait, I know what killed the dinos! It was capitalism, look at the oil! (Idea by Samuel Green)",

    "vyvyxyn": "Vyvyxyn is a colorful ore representing the six colors of rainbow due to its formation from prismatic crystals. Yes, there are 6 colors, fun fact Issac Newton added indigo because he wanted them to be 7 colors for good luck. (Designed by Samuel Green)",
    "xyxyvylyn": "Xyxyvylyn is a dark counterpart of Vyvyxyn. Sometimes it is grinded into a very expensive and spicy salt and used in trace amounts to give extra spice to meals. Eating too much can make you act edgy or like a Roblox roleplayer. (Designed by Samuel Green)",
    "chilledamethyst": "The Chilled Amethyst is an amethyst transformed by extreme pressure and cold. The improbable conditions of it forming in an average climate make it only findable at night.

    "patricine": "[EVENT ORE] Patricine is said to make anyone who gets near it lucky. Over time its effects seem have to been deteriorating, but it is still actively giving miners near it some better luck.",
    "crysor": "Crysor is a very cold material. Apparently dogs like to lick it for some reason. We think the reason is because it feels good on their snoot. (Idea, design, and description by Samuel Green)",
    "porvileon": "Porvileon sends objects who touch it into another dimension. Nobody knows where it goes because humans can't fit through it. Many theories have sparked of where it goes. Some notable ones are The End, planet Y78aÆg.j, or to the 4th dimension. (Idea and design by Samuel Green)",
    "mysalin": "Mysalin is a funky ore. Contrary to popular belief, it is actually a crystal. It formed during a volcano and blizzard at the same time, causing it to be StrAnGe lol xd. It is completely offcentered contrary to the perfectionist beauty of other crystals.",

    "pyrite": "Pyrite is called fool's gold because it looks like gold. But that's not true, it's called fool's gold because I commited some mild tomfoolery on 75% of all gold blocks in this mine which made them into pyrite (true story) (Idea by Samuel Green)",
    "platnium": "Platnium is often proccessed into bars for rappers to use during a battle. In a rap battle, whoever brings more bars wins the battle. This is not bribery in ANY shape or form.",
    "foliatite": "plamceholdar (if you get the chance good job) (Designed by Samuel Green)"
